					<p>Melanee is developing Feather Coffee into a business model she calls "cause-brewing." She plans to franchise the business so that more people can make a difference. People in the rare disease community can buy a Feather Coffee trailer and raise money for their cause in a consistent and flexible way.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-multi">
					<p>Also, anyone interested in starting a socially conscious mobile-coffee business can buy a Feather Coffee trailer. No matter who invests in a franchise, a percentage of the profits will be donated to rare disease organizations.</p>

She transformed her diagnosis into a warrant for a new life and decided to use her creativity, business acumen, and passion for the rare disease community to start Feather Coffee.

					<h3>Jon Joiner</h3>
					Filmmaker
					<p><img data-src="images/jon.jpg" src="images/blind.gif" class="team-picture transitionable-opacity invisible" alt="Jon" />If Jon Joiner isn't riding a bicycle, DIY-ing crafty goods, road-tripping in his Vanagon, or taking a GoPro-strapped drone to unexplored heights, he's likely making films. Actually, he's often found wielding a camera while riding his bike, crafting stuff, and road-tripping, too. His wide range of interests have unintentionally made him one of the world's greatest multitaskers. Over the past seven years, people have asked Jon to turn his camera in the direction of their weddings, concerts, and conferences. He's personable enough that people have also asked him to collaborate on documentaries and short films. He and his wife are both cat people, but don't let that stop you from reaching out.</p>
