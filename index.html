				<div class="col-multi">
					<p>Melanee Grondahl transformed a rare lung disease diagnosis into the warrant for a new life, new business, and a new perspective on how to engage in the world around her. Instead of hiding inside her shell and behind her diagnosis, she decided to use her creativity, business acumen, and passion for developing community to help the 350 million people around the world who are affected by rare diseases.</p>
					<p>Combining her desire to create connection in the middle of a tough diagnosis with her love of coffee and food trucks, Melanee developed Feather Coffee, a mobile coffee business that shares its profits with rare disease organizations while promoting products that give back as well.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-multi">
					<p>For instance, Feather Coffee has partnered with Three Avocados Coffee, a coffee supplier whose profits are used to fund water and education projects in Uganda and Nicaragua.</p>
					<p>Creating a "Cause-Brewing" Business:</p>
					<p>While building a successful business rooted in Chico, CA, Melanee is developing Feather Coffee into a business model that can be franchised so that people in communities across the country can create their own profits to share with even more organizations that remain committed to funding research and curing rare diseases.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-multi">
					<p><b>How You Can Be Involved Right Now:</b></p>
					<p>While Feather Coffee's crowd-funding video is currently in post-production and its fundraising campaign will launch in April, you can still help this business find its roots! You can learn more about Melanee's story and vision, and you can follow Feather Coffee's journey, on social media.</p>
					<p>We will also be updating this website with information. Bookmark Feather Coffee on your web-browser and check back often. Be in touch with us with questions. And be on the lookout for our upcoming campaign and then look for the Feather Coffee truck in the very near future!</p>
					<i>We appreciate your support!</i>

					<h3>Jon Joiner</h3>
					<p><img data-src="images/jon.jpg" src="images/blind.gif" class="team-picture transitionable-opacity invisible" alt="Jon" />If Jon Joiner isn't riding a bicycle, DIY-ing crafty goods, road-tripping in his Vanagon, or taking a GoPro-strapped drone to unexplored heights, he's likely making films. Actually, he's often found wielding a camera while riding his bike, crafting stuff, and road-tripping, too. His wide range of interests have unintentionally made him one of the world's greatest multitaskers. Over the past seven years, people have asked Jon to turn his camera in the direction of their weddings, concerts, and conferences. He's personable enough that people have also asked him to collaborate on documentaries and short films. He and his wife are both cat people, but don't let that stop you from reaching out.</p>
