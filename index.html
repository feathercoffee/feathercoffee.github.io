				<div class="col-multi">
					<p>After being diagnosed with a rare lung disease, Melanee decided she wanted to provide a consistent way to raise funds for those affected by rare diseases. Subsequently, she founded Feather Coffee, a mobile-coffee company that gives a percentage of its profits to rare disease organizations. To help raise start-up funds, she is embarking on a Kickstarter campaign that will go live April 29.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-multi">
					<p>Her vision for the future of Feather Coffee is to develop the business model she calls "cause-brewing" into a franchise so that more people can make a difference in the fight against rare diseases. People in the rare disease community can buy a Feather Coffee trailer and raise money for their cause in a consistent and flexible way.</p>

					Founder Feather Coffee
					<p><img data-src="images/melanee.jpg" src="images/blind.gif" class="team-picture transitionable-opacity invisible" alt="Melanee" />Melanee was diagnosed with a rare lung disease called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thelamfoundation.org/what-is-lam">Lymphangioleiomyomatosis</a> or LAM in April 2013. She transformed her diagnosis into a warrant for a new life and decided to use her creativity, business acumen, and passion for the rare disease community to start Feather Coffee.

					<h3>Jon Joiner</h3>
					Filmmaker
					<p><img data-src="images/jon.jpg" src="images/blind.gif" class="team-picture transitionable-opacity invisible" alt="Jon" />If Jon Joiner isn't riding a bicycle, DIY-ing crafty goods, road-tripping in his Vanagon, or taking a GoPro-strapped drone to unexplored heights, he's likely making films. Actually, he's often found wielding a camera while riding his bike, crafting stuff, and road-tripping, too. His wide range of interests have unintentionally made him one of the world's greatest multitaskers. Over the past seven years, people have asked Jon to turn his camera in the direction of their weddings, concerts, and conferences. He's personable enough that people have also asked him to collaborate on documentaries and short films. He and his wife are both cat people, but don't let that stop you from reaching out.</p>
